# Machine Learning - Coursera

I am taking the course [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) on Coursera, taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. This course provides the foundation of Machine Learning, with most of the code written in MATLAB. This repository contains the code record for the programming assignment in the course.

## Course Structure

Below is the Course Structure for anyone who wish to navigate the repositories easier:

### Week 1: Linear Regression with One Variable
* Introduction
* Linear Regression with One Variable
* Linear Algebra Review

### Week 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* Octave/Matlab Tutorial
* **Programming Exercise 1**

### Week 3: (To be Updated)

## Acknowledgement

These knowledge and course, while written by me, will not be made possible without the extraordinary and outstanding lecture from Prof. Andrew Ng. This is a really great course and I recommend for anyone who wants to enter the field of Machine Learning.

## Future work

Due to the rising popularity of Python in Machine Learning and AI, I intend to make Python version of the programming assignments as well as the model discussed in the course.
